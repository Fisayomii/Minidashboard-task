# Minidashboard-task
This project is a mini-dashboard application built with React, TypeScript, and other libraries such as Axios, React Query, React Icons, and React To Print. The dashboard enables users to interact with posts, display them in a table format, paginate the data, search, and sort the results based on column headers.

Data Table: Displays posts data with columns for ID, User ID, Title, and Body.
Pagination: Displays 10 items per page, with navigation buttons to go to the previous or next pages.
Sorting: Allows sorting of the table by ID, Title, and Body columns.
Search: Allows searching through the posts by keyword.
React Query: Utilized for data fetching and caching, improving performance and state management.
React To Print: Enables users to print data for the selected post.


- Libraries Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
Vite: A next-generation, fast build tool for modern web development.
Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend API.
React Query: Data fetching, caching, and synchronization for React.
